title Reliably Creating an Order

Client -> Service: POST http://.../.../orders/
note right of Service: service creates new resource and marks it available but incomplete
Service -> Client: HTTP 201 Created\nLocation: http://..../.../orders/x-y-z
note left of Client: if the client fails to receive a URL, \nit can retry until it succeeds (idempotent)
note right of Service: the service should garbage collect unused resources
Client -> Service: PUT http://.../.../orders/x-y-z with JSON payload
Service -> Client: HTTP 200 OK
note left of Client: client can retry until 200 OK is received\nThis ensures successful delivery exactly once.
